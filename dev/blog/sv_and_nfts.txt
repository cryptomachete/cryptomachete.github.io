1/ I know you're here for the art, the community and the promise of something better. Meanwhile, why not read some musings on "(Subjective) value and NFTs" First of many blog posts in twitter ðŸ§µ format. #PAfollowPA #WeAreTheNight

2/ What is value even? It's one of those concepts that's been discussed to death and as Vilfrido Pareto put it, it's not even clear people are talking about the same thing. Pareto himself was an economist/sociologist, talking about value in the economic sense but others also discuss value in ethics,

3/ aesthetics, religion, psychology, anthropology, neuroscience. (How does value relate to NFTs? In myriad ways touched upon the different ways at looking at value. We'll get back to that.) In philosophy, Max Scheler attempted to argue for an objective ranking of values, with spiritual ones at the very top.

4/ I like to think of objective values as the idea that if an alien was to assess the object (whether it's a work of art, a spiritual experience or an NFT) there is a computationally explicit procedure to provide a similar ranking.

5/ If we talk about subjective value though, there the idea is that we all have our arbitrary preferences (within evolutionary and physical constraints) and that consensus can emerge out of such arbitrary set of preferences. (excuse the blunt simplification, this is a twitter thread after all)

6/ If you talk with a cognitive neuroscientist, they might have a different view on the objective/subjective split. For them a thing's price could be the objective value (set my market consensus obviously) and the signal in a part of the brain called ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, more or less behind your third eye)

7/ would correlate with an individual's preference for said object.
